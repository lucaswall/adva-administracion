## Conventions

Rules for agents creating, updating, or managing features in this file.

### Feature Structure

Every feature **must** have these sections in this order:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Problem** | What's wrong or missing. 2-3 sentences max. No solution language. |
| **Prerequisites** | Other features or Linear issues that must be done first. Omit if none. |
| **Goal** | What the feature achieves for the user. 1-2 sentences. |
| **Design** | The meat: UX flows, behavior rules, UI details. Sub-sections vary by feature. |
| **Architecture** | Technical decisions: storage, APIs, state management. Omit if purely UI. |
| **Edge Cases** | Non-obvious scenarios and how to handle them. |
| **Implementation Order** | Numbered list of steps, ordered by dependency. |

### Writing Rules

- **Problem-focused.** Describe what's wrong, not how to fix it. The Design section handles solutions.
- **Concise.** Each section earns its space. If a section adds nothing beyond what's obvious, cut it.
- **No implementation code.** Reference file paths and patterns, but don't write code. That's for Linear issues and plan-implement.
- **User-facing language in Problem/Goal.** Technical details belong in Architecture.
- **Edge Cases are not Limitations.** Edge cases describe specific scenarios and their handling. Limitations are fundamental constraints (e.g., "requires network") -- fold these into Architecture or Edge Cases.

### Identification

- Features use **stable slug IDs** as their heading anchor (e.g., `## Date Navigation` -> anchor `#date-navigation`).
- Slugs never change once a feature is added. This keeps external references (chats, notes, Linear issues) valid.
- Cross-references within this file use markdown links: `[Date Navigation](#date-navigation)`.

### Adding and Removing Features

- New features are appended before the Conventions section. Position in the contents table reflects rough priority.
- When a feature is fully moved to Linear (all issues created), **remove it** from the file. Do not leave stubs.
- When removing a feature, update the Contents table and fix any cross-references in remaining features. Use the plain feature name in prerequisite references -- no Linear issue IDs, links, or "moved to" annotations. The backlog is always fully processed before pulling more features from this file.

### When to Move to Linear

A feature moves from this file to Linear Backlog when:
1. The design is detailed enough for `plan-backlog` to create implementation plans.
2. Prerequisites are done or in progress.
3. The feature is approved for implementation.

Move the **entire feature or a self-contained phase** -- don't create Linear issues for half a feature while the other half stays here. When a feature is too large, split it into separate features first, then move them independently.

### Splitting Features

If a feature grows beyond ~60 lines or contains clearly independent phases:
1. Extract each phase into its own feature with a new heading.
2. Set prerequisites between them as needed.
3. Update the Contents table.

### Contents Table

The table at the top must stay in sync. When adding or removing features, update the table. Each row has: linked feature name and a one-sentence summary.

- **Read-Only Access** - Safe for production use with readonly scopes
- **Pure TypeScript** - No build process, runs directly with tsx

## Tools

### gdrive_search

Search for files in Google Drive by name.

**Input:**
- `query` (string, required): Search query (searches file names)
- `pageToken` (string, optional): Token for pagination
- `pageSize` (number, optional): Results per page (max 100, default 10)

**Output:** List of files with IDs, names, and MIME types.

**Example:**
```
query: "invoice"
→ Returns all files with "invoice" in the name
```

### gdrive_read_file

Read contents of a file from Google Drive.

**Input:**
- `fileId` (string, required): ID of the file to read

**Output:** File contents. Google Docs export as Markdown, Sheets as CSV, regular files as text or base64.

**Example:**
```
fileId: "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
→ Returns file contents
```

### gdrive_list_folder

List files and folders in a Google Drive folder.

**Input:**

- `pageSize` (number, optional): Results per page (max 100, default 10)

**Output:** List of files AND folders (subfolders) with ID, name, mimeType, size. Folders are identified by `mimeType: 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'`.

```
folderId: "1rC3eH-Z2TPZrjktLF9xn93WxlY-ZPU4m"

```

### gsheets_read

Read data from a Google Spreadsheet.

**Input:**
- `spreadsheetId` (string, required): The spreadsheet ID
- `ranges` (string[], optional): A1 notation ranges like `['Sheet1!A1:B10']`
- `sheetId` (number, optional): Specific sheet ID to read

```

## Environment Variables

This server uses the parent project's `.env` file (automatically loaded from `../`):

```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<base64-encoded-json>
```

The service account must have read access to the Drive files/folders you want to access.

## Claude Code Configuration

Add to your Claude Code settings (`~/.config/claude-code/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/Users/lucaswall/Projects/adva-administracion/mcp-gdrive/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with explicit env var:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/Users/lucaswall/Projects/adva-administracion/mcp-gdrive/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY": "<base64-encoded-json>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running Manually

```bash
cd /Users/lucaswall/Projects/adva-administracion/mcp-gdrive
npm install
npm start
```

## Development

No build process required - TypeScript runs directly via tsx.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run server
npx tsx index.ts
```

## Shared Drives Support

All API calls include proper Shared Drives support:
- `supportsAllDrives: true`
- `includeItemsFromAllDrives: true`

This ensures the server works seamlessly with both My Drive and Shared Drives.

## Read-Only Scopes

The server uses these OAuth scopes:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly`

This ensures the server cannot modify or delete any files.

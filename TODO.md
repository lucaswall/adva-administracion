Improvement #1
When I find bugs after processing files y find myself repeating over and over what MCPs are availiable and pasting paths to gdrive and spreadsheets. I want a skill similar to plan-todo by called plan-fix. I will pass arguemts explaining the bug, with contxt and all, but the skill should make the agent know it can use the availiable MCPs and get folder info con CLAUDE.md. We should not hardcode the MCPs or struncture into the skill, because we would have to update it each time we change stuff. But we need the agent to get the right context to correcly investigante. Also the agent should only make a plan, like plan-todo, not start changing stuff. After this I can continue with the implement and review loop.
